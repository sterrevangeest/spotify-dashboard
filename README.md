# Spotify Mood Dashboard

In this dashboard I want to let users discover what effects the time of the year and different events (such as COVID-19) have on our mood by visualizing which music we listen to the most over time.

### Background

Spotify has an algorithm that classifies a song‚Äôs **‚Äúvalence‚Äù**, or how happy it sounds, on a scale from 0 to 100. The algorithm is trained on ratings of positivity by musical experts, and gives Aretha Franklin‚Äôs soaring ‚ÄúRespect‚Äù a score of 97; Radiohead‚Äôs gloomy ‚ÄúCreep‚Äù gets just 10 (The Economist, 2020).

Since 2017 Spotify has also published daily and weekly tables of the 200 most-streamed songs, both worldwide and in each country on [Spotify Charts](https://spotifycharts.com/regional).

### Data Sources

**Scraping Spotify Charts**

I use the Spotify Charts website to find out which songs most people are listening to since 2017. I need to scrape the website to get the data I need. A developer, @hktosun, has built a scraper (see [Spotify_WebScraper.py](https://gist.github.com/hktosun/d4f98488cb8f005214acd12296506f48)) in Python for this website before. I tweaked the code a bit (see [spotify-charts-scraper.py](https://github.com/sterrevangeest/spotify-dashboard/blob/master/spotify-charts-scraper.py)) to get all the necessary data.

The following information is retrieved from the website and exported to a `.csv` file:

| Song                                          | Artist                | Date       | Streams    | Url                                                   | Rank |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---- |
| Sunflower - Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse | Post Malone, Swae Lee | 2019-01-04 | 32,548,077 | https://open.spotify.com/track/3KkXRkHbMCARz0aVfEt68P | 1    |
| thank u, next                                 | Ariana Grande         | 2019-01-04 | 29,904,412 | https://open.spotify.com/track/2rPE9A1vEgShuZxxzR2tZH | 2    |

**etc...** (see [data/global.csv](https://github.com/sterrevangeest/spotify-dashboard/blob/master/data/global.csv) for the whole dataset).

**Spotify Api**

I can retrieve the audio features from a track from the Spotify Api by using the url of the song. The most important value for me will be the valence value: a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)(Get Audio Features for a Track | Spotify for Developers, n.d.).

```
GET https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-features/{id}
```

The API will return the following:

```json
{
 "duration_ms": 255349,
 "key": 5,
 "mode": 0,
 "time_signature": 4,
 "acousticness": 0.514,
 "danceability": 0.735,
 "energy": 0.578,
 "instrumentalness": 0.0902,
 "liveness": 0.159,
 "loudness": -11.84,
 "speechiness": 0.0461,
 "valence": 0.624,
 "tempo": 98.002,
 "id": "06AKEBrKUckW0KREUWRnvT",
 "uri": "spotify:track:06AKEBrKUckW0KREUWRnvT",
 "track_href": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/06AKEBrKUckW0KREUWRnvT",
 "analysis_url": "https://api.spotify.com/v1/audio-analysis/06AKEBrKUckW0KREUWRnvT",
 "type": "audio_features"
}
```

### Skills & obstacles

For creating the dashboard I need to dive deeper into Dash and Plotly. In the previous assignments we created relatively simple charts and graphs. It may become a bit more challenging now that that have a lot more data to plot.

I have to make a lot of requests to get all the valance values for every track from the Spotify Api. I check if there is a request limit. When developing the dashboard it may be useful to use some mock data.
